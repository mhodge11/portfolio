I am an accomplished Full Stack Software Engineer with over seven years of experience, specializing in Swift, JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, and SQL, across various frameworks. My portfolio includes the development of iOS applications, cross-platform applications using React Native, as well as web applications utilizing React and the more recent Next.js. I am proficient in creating both RESTful and GraphQL APIs, often employing Express.js as the foundational framework.

This experience has equipped me with the problem-solving skills essential for tackling a diverse range of challenges.
